# Java-Console-Calculator

This is a simple command-line calculator built in Java. It allows a user to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers.

### Key Concepts

This project was built to demonstrate several core Java concepts:
* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** The code is organized into a class with methods for each operation.
* **Methods:** Separate methods are used for input, validation, and performing calculations, which makes the code modular and easy to read.
* **Conditionals:** A `switch` statement handles the different operators, and `if` statements handle errors like division by zero.
* **Loops:** A `while` loop allows the user to perform multiple calculations without restarting the program.
* **Input/Output (I/O):** The `Scanner` class is used to read user input from the console.
